# Lab 1: Basys introduction

This lab exercise introduces the design software used in this class and Basys
board used for design implementation. This exercise verifies that you have the
software installed correctly and that your Basys board is operational.

You must demonstrate to the TA that you completed both the simulation step and
the board mapping step in this lab. There is no report required.

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that you have the Vivado software installed; follow the
    [provided directions](vivado_install.md).
2.  Follow the steps in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/8eK8Bqg6_Zs) to
    simulate this design in Vivado and download it to the Basys 3 board. This
    video was made with Vivado 2015.2; the look of the current tool version has
    changed somewhat since that time. However, you should still be able to use
    this video to implement this lab.
3.  Vivado 2015.2; the look of the current tool version has changed somewhat
    since that time. However, you should still be able to use this video to
    implement this lab.
4.  Demo your simulation step and completed design operating on the Basys 3
    board to the TA.
