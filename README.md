# Digital System Design Labs (ECE 4743)

Welcome to the repository for the Digital System Design labs at Mississippi State University. This course, ECE 4743, is structured to provide a hands-on approach to hierarchical digital design, leveraging state-of-the-art design software and CAD workstations.

This repository contains all my lab work and projects done as part of this course. Each folder represents a specific lab task, and inside you'll find both the initial design files and the final outputs, demonstrating the application of course concepts through real-world digital design scenarios.
